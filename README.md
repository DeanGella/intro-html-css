## Intro HTML/CSS

This will be a short open eded workshop to get you started with HTML and CSS.

It's important to learn that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but **markup langugaes** - shortcut languages to tell browsers to do something.

Truly, the only way learn HTML is to *make things*! Make yourself a website, or write a JavaScript game... **learn by doing**.

### [Very Quick Guide](./reference/README.md)

We're repurposing out HTML and CSS reference from out [Intro Web](https://github.com/dvcoders/intro-web) meeting because there is not much to teach on our part.

You should be googling, searching, tinkering, and asking questions in order to learn HTML.

**Use These Resources**:

- 	[Code Academy HTML/CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website) - Code Academy is a self-paced, easy to follow, tutorial in the basics of web site creation.
-  [HTML Cheatsheet ](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/html_cheatsheet/) - Here's shorthand reference for some HTML elements you might want to use. If you find something you want to use, Search "How to use <element> to do ____"
-  [CSS Cheatsheet](http://learnxinyminutes.com/css) - A general way to use CSS

**Note**: The best way to learn HTML/CSS is to use `Inspect Element` on an existing webpage to learn how existing HTML and CSS interact. Using your browser's developer tools, you can see how CSS classes and ids affect HTML display.

**Note**: Avoid W3Schools! W3Schools has very low quality content and generally doesn't teach you anything, Try out the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) which has excellent developer documentation.

### [Project](./project/README.md)
